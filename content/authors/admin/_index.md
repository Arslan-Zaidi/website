My name is Arslan Zaidi and I'm a statistical geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm interested in understanding how demographic processes such as admixture, population bottlenecks, expansions, non-random mating, and selection shape genetic variation underlying complex traits in humans.


I am from Pakistan, where I completed my undergraduate degree in genetics from the University of Karachi. My graduate work, which I did with <a href="http://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/genomics/the-lab/people">Mark Shriver</a>&nbsp;at Penn State, focused on studying the evolutionary genetics of physical traits such as skin pigmentation and 3D facial shape. Then I did a postdoc with <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/makova_lab/">Kateryna Makova</a>, also at Penn State, where I studied the transmission dynamics of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmies in human families, and mito-nuclear interactions in admixed populations. Currently, I'm a postdoc with <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/mathieson-lab/">Iain Mathieson</a> at The University of Pennsylvania. I am continuing to explore the phenotypic effects of mito-nuclear interactions in admixed human populations. I'm also study how human demographic history and population stratification impact inference in large-scale genome-wide association studies.
